# A project that basically brings the coolness of Trello to Github issues

State goals:
 - drag and drop issues between 'stacks'
 - edit issues, comments etc


Implementation goals:
 - zero config - only conventions and leveragint the Github API
 - implemented as a chrome plugin (but in a way to port easy to somewhere else too)


 - A 'stack' is a tag with a format like 's1 Todo'
 - Any issue with multiple stack tags will be in the 'earliest' stack
 - A stack can have a colour
