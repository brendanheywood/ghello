# A project that basically brings the coolness of Trello to Github issues

Project goals:

 - Bring drag and drop issues between 'stacks' and easy to see and use metaphor
 - edit issues, comments etc
 - zero config, only conventions and leveragint the Github API


Conventions:

 - A 'stack' is a tag with a format like 's1 Todo'
 - Any issue with multiple stack tags will be in the 'earliest' stack
 - A stack can have a colour (unlike Trello)
 - A comment which includes a list can have [ ] and [x] to indicate done items


Exclusions:

 - Live updating
 - Votes are left out for now (not sure on a convention?)
 - Tasks can only be assigned to one person at a time
